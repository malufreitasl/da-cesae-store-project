## Overview
This was a python mini project for a Data Analysis course. "Papelaria Chicotis" is a store that simulates a sale of items through menus in the terminal. The system allows the costumers to do registration in the system, selection, and purchase of products, while also offering other functionalities for administrators and employees.

## Key Features

### Authentication of Users
Customers can register in the system, while only administrators have permission to register employees. User authentication for all actors.

### Purchases
To make an item purchase, the customer must select the desired product and quantity. During checkout, the system displays a summary of the purchase, with the selected items and their costs. Customers can then proceed to payment. After confirming the purchase, the system generates a customer receipt, providing detailed information about the transaction.

### Inventory Management
Employees are responsible for dealing with the stock. They can create new items and add existing products to the system.

### Employee Administration
The system administrator manages employees, with the ability to add, remove and/or update employees.

### Reports
Administrators have the ability to generate and access reports of the store.

### Hope you enjoy
This was a small project, that while lacking a sophisticated interface, was a valuable test of my Python knowledge, focusing on CRUDE (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions and some data analysis. I hope you find it interesting and enjoyable.

Thank you for exploring my project!
